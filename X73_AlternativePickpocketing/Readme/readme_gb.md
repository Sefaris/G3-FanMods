Description: This modification reworks the mechanics of pickpocketing, making it similar to analogues from "Gothic 2: Night of the Raven" and "The Chronicles of Myrtana: Archolos". All named NPCs now have personalized pickpocketing scripts and a unique loot; the chance of failure is completely eliminated: The Hero can either pick the pockets of his victim or not.

Special thanks: 
Mac Hyder a.k.a Летучий for permission to implement the mechanics of leveling a thief's skill, which coincides with his thief mini-mod.
