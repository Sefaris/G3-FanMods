This modification significantly reduces the game fog that hides distant lands. In essence, there is an increase in the rendering distance without loss of performance. The effect is especially noticeable in Nordmar.

Note: After installing this mod, you must reload the ShaderCache file. The game will do this automatically when you first launch it. Do not try to get a backup of this file in the Documents folder.
