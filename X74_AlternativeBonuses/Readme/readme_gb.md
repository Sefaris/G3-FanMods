Description: The modification reworks the player's receipt of permanent bonuses, which in the original game were achieved by completing certain quests. The changes are mainly intended for perfectionists who, when playing with Alternative Balancing, were forced to postpone certain quests until the time when the target attribute will be leveled up to 250+. The modification offers five modes, one of which is activated through the old diary of the Hero lying in the inventory.
Standard: quest bonuses has been replaced by stone tablets familiar from "Gothic 2: Night of the Raven". If certain conditions are met, they can be purchased from some artifact merchants through a special dialogue;
Alternative: all teachers, if the hero has certain talents, can offer additional training, which will allow you to raise a limited number of attribute points for gold without investing learning points;
Classic: bonuses are awarded for quests, the main functions of the mod are disabled. It starts automatically if the activation dialog was skipped;
Rational: for completing quests, the hero receives learning points instead of attribute points;
Hardcore: quest bonuses have been removed from the game; the functions of the other modes are not involved.
