This modification presents only 2 changes:
1) The hero's movements in any direction (back, right, left, diagonally) are equal in speed to forward movement;
2) Instant turn of the hero to follow the camera.

Note: This modification is recommended only for playing with the classic camera and does not work well with the alternative camera.
Note 2: The gameplay for the archer has been slightly simplified.
