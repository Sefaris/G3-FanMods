Requirements: Main, Conquest

Large concentrations of potential enemies are enclaves and will attack the hero en masse during battle.
(Like when liberating a city)

List of new enclaves:
- Ortega's Bandit Camp
- Bandit Camp on the Road to Montera
- Kurt's Bandit Camp
- Ivan's Bandit Camp
- Orc Patrol in Gotha
- Anog's Rebel Camp
- Orc Siege Ring near Vengard

Warning! With this mod, there is a possibility of a bug when after a save/load, new enclaves change their attitude towards the player potentially becoming hostile. To avoid the bug, save before interacting with the enclave, or restart the game.
