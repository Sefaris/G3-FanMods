Requirements: Main

Mages around the world are acquiring new magic staves with characteristic magic damage. For fire mages - fire staves, for water mages - ice staves, for dark mages - electric staves. In the original game, the "Energy Defense" attribute is useless due to the lack of opponents with energy damage. Now there are some. The mechanics of elemental enchantment for swords and shields have been added using special stones, with the "Enchanting" skill learned. A skill has been added that allows you to change the grip of two-handed swords to one-handed.
