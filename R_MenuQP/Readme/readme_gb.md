This mod is not compatible with the following mods: MenuCM, MenuOLD, MenuDark, MenuArcania, UpdatedGUI, Immersive World

This modification reworks the game interface, making it similar to Gothic 2. The compass is still there, but without a frame.

Note: This interface already has a compass, so there is no point in bringing it back.
