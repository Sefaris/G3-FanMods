Requirements: Main

Continuation of the idea of other mods on interactive interaction with blacksmiths. You can smelt raw ore and rusty weapons into iron blanks. Smelting can be done at any blacksmith or in a smelting furnace. The requirements and cost of blanks are the same for all blacksmiths and at the smelting furnace. You can also smelt gold and ore in the furnace. Also included is the LTM quest for gold bars as a gift to the guard of Ishtar to increase reputation with the Hashishin.
