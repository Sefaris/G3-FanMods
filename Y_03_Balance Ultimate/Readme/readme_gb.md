Not compatible with Immersive World mod without Balance Ultimate & Immersive World compatibility mod

A global rebalancing mod, the purpose of which is to create a common, consistent balance of all content from other modifications (CM, QP, LTM), as well as to remove various "freebies" that violated the order of equipment extraction intended by the developers. Example: Templar Armor in CM, obtained from the belly of a crawler, makes it pointless to buy armor with similar characteristics from factions, since it does not require monetary costs and completing reputation quests.
Other examples: Dragon Hunter armor (from a pirate's corpse), gladiator armor (can be taken from a gladiator), guardsman armor (can be taken from Cobrin), heavy militia armor (can be taken from the leader of Nemora).
Added crafting recipes for these items.
During development, the modification went far beyond its original goals.
Features:
- New magic bolts for crossbows and bows.
- Repaired summoning and transformation magic.
- Accelerated casting of some spells.
- New spells and perks.
- Complete rework of all spells, perks and equipment.
- Reworked game classes: mage, druid, thief, paladin.
