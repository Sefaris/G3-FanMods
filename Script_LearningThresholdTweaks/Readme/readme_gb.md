Needs the activation of the alternative balance setting in the main menu.

Now you don't need to put off completing tasks and potions with permanent attribute increases for later, use them as soon as you can, the game no longer punishes you for this!
The plugin changes the system of restrictions in increasing attributes with a threshold of 250 strength, dexterity and ancient knowledge. There are flexible settings, click the "Open script settings" button to change the values, there are optional: lightweight (without training thresholds) and hardcore (with additional training thresholds) modes. By default, the threshold is like in Alternative Balance 250 attributes. Permanents are not taken into account, and this can be disabled.
