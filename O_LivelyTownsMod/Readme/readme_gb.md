Requirement: Main, UpdatePack v1.04, ParallelUniversePatch

The mod was created with the aim of making the cities more "alive" after their liberation, by adding new NPCs, quests and items. Some of those ideas taken from the Czech MYINA mod.

This mod contains:
- New characters in liberated cities;
- All LTM quests in liberated cities and beyond;
- New monsters and mini-bosses;
- Achievements;
- Caches, secrets and random events;
- New chests around the world;
- Changes in appearance for each city in Myrtana;
- Doors for all houses in Myrtana;
- Some houses have become two-story;
- Esmeralda can be found in the game.

Note: The LTM mod has been split into several components. Carefully read the description of all modifications to install the changes you are interested in!

Some features:
- Some quests can be completed in different ways;
- Depending on the hero's developed skills, new dialogue lines will be available (only in LTM quests);
- Some tasks become available after certain conditions are met;
- Each character in Cape Dun, Gotha, Laga, Ben Sala and Ardea is unique, has their own armor or clothes. All residents have their own daily routine;
- Artifacts from Al Shedim can be sold to Aldo, Fezul and Ilya;
- Some characters will move from place to place. For example, traders or rebels can walk between settlements;
- After the liberation of Cape Dun, the coastal territory is again populated by animals, bandits and monsters;
- It is possible to get an unworn Ogre's Morningstar (you need to complete a certain quest);
- Added the ability to repair the royal shield and sword at the blacksmith Cliff in Reddock (you must first free him from the orcs).
