Requirements: Main

This mod adds a new storyline to the game, built around the revenge of our friend Lee on King Rhobar. The plot involves most of the population of Vengard, as well as characters from Nordmar, and will lead to three different endings depending on the choice of factions. This version of the mod is LTM compatible. Numerous bugs and shortcomings have been fixed. If you do not want to go through the quest chain, you can choose the vanilla option in the dialogue with Lee.
