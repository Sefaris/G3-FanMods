Requirements: Main

Makes changes to the hero's thieving adventures. Adds new quests and improves several old ones. For example, Trelis's treasury is locked with a key, and to get it, you will need to use one of the thief skills: pickpocketing or stunning.
For completing all the thieves' quests in the game, you can get the Master's lockpick, which can open almost any chest without breaking. Such a thing will be useful in the second half of the game, when opening dozens of chests with small loot becomes boring and tedious. But this does not mean that it will be easy to get and forget about increasing your lockpicking skills. The player will have to try hard and visit almost all the cities in the game.
