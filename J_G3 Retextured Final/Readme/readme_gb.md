Hello my friends! I hope you are all healthy and happy! Now I want to publish my final version! Since I am not going to continue, but I also do not want to hide my latest status from you, I am publishing it now! A lot has changed in the latest beta 0.8! About 400 new textures for the latest version! Here you can watch a video comparing the old and new! But I could make some comparison photos. That is why I would like to inform you that with this release I am saying goodbye to Gothic modding forever. I have been a member of the club since November 25, 2009, when I turned 15. Today I am 30 years old and I have had a very good time in the modding community. Thanks to them I have learned a lot and grown a lot in 2D! I say thank you all! I would also like to give you permission to use my data for your mods, but please give me credit! Thank you, dear Gothic world
