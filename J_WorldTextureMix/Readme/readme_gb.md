This modification is not compatible with the following mods: QPTexture, MyrtanaTexturePack, PreAlpha, AutumnTextures, SmartTexturesPack, RetexturedFinal.

This mod adds very realistic textures. The colour scheme of the world is based on the basic game. As of this version, I have the ability to add unique textures anywhere in the game world, making the mod the only one with a lot of variety. With each update the diversity of the mod will increase.
