This modification has plot inconsistencies with the CM End Game mod.

This modification completely reworks the pirate quest line from LTM, turning it into a full-fledged storyline in a pirate camp.
The player must earn the right to join the team, carry out the captain's orders, search for treasures and earn the respect of the crew.
Depending on the player's actions, several endings are possible with different fates for each of the team members.

Note: The LTM mod itself is recommended, but not required to be installed.

- A full-fledged pirate camp;

- The ability to get on board Esmeralda;
- Slave Herek will be able to repay the debt to the hero if he helps him free from slavery;
