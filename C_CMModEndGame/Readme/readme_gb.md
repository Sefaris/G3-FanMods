Requirement: CMLetters

This modification complements the main ContentMod with an imitation of transferring a save from Gothic 2. At the beginning of the game, in a dialogue with Milten, you will be able to specify your actions in Gothic 2, after which you will be able to get some of your things back. Beware, this mod can break the balance of equipment progression!
